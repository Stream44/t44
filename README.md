Terminal44 Workspace Foundation
===

> Bedrock in a storm of constant change. A web3 + AI ready workspace you can build an empire on.

The `t44` workspace foundation running on [bun](https://bun.sh) enables you to build any project of any complexity by providing fundamental capabilities needed by any modern software development toolchain & process.

The primary audience is **Full-Stack JavaScript developers** looking for an *offline first, always online* home for their projects.

**Get started with pre-built applications in a matter of minutes: [github.com/Stream44/t44-starter](https://github.com/Stream44/t44-starter)**

Build against a novel [PrivateData.Space](https://privatedata.space/) architecture that projects the runtime system from declared logic in a codebase structured for a flowing creation process. Complexity is no problem when code is encapsulated and identified as related components throughout the entire codebase.

The approach enables rapid creation & adoption of new technology by re-framing existing logic for new runtime environments. It enables model-driven development. It allows for the precipitation of logic into stable long-term thought models and implementation architectures that make teams and users happy. The approach and architecture embodied within is the result of multiple decades of active exploration.

This is an **open development project** built by [Christoph](https://christoph.diy) using [Stream44.Studio](https://Stream44.Studio), *A **full-stack IDE** for building **embodied distributed systems***.

Goals
---

- Human first with AI tools
- Simple to understand and work with
- Deploy from one codebase to many providers and runtimes
- A lasting foundation for the next generation of distributed applications & systems
- Rapid development for web2 and web3
- Always at static rest with running expression giving instant feedback on change
- Ability to integrate any technology at will

See [*The Workspace Foundation Perspective / Vision*](#the-workspace-foundation-perspective--vision) below for more details.

Status
---

This project is in **early development** and not ready for production use. Everything is subject to change although you should be able to refactor your codebase using AI to keep up if needed.

For now it is best used for small projects and exploration in non-mission critical settings.

Get in touch at [discord.gg](https://discord.gg/9eBcQXEJAN) ([Stream44.Studio](https://Stream44.Studio) server) if you are running it and need support.

The Workspace Foundation Perspective / Vision
===

The perspective embodied in the workspace implementation aims to cohere
timeless principles towards an approach of creation able to sustain
the development of complex systems over time.

The perspective is an evolving definition that will be grounded in practical
implementation able to produce immediate results for the user.

[Christoph](https://christoph.diy) has been working on refining this perspective and implementations for a long time. You will be able to watch the system unfold in front of you and immediately leverage new features in your projects as functionality is mapped onto a central spine throughout 2026 and beyond.

Following are glimpses of what the perspective must encompass and for which implementations will be forthcoming.


Timless Principles
---

- [ ] Human First
- [ ] Open Participation
- [ ] Offline First & Always Online
- [ ] Infinite Complexity Accomodation
- [ ] Arbitrary Logic Embodyment
- [ ] Instant Feedback
- [ ] Rapid Iteration
- [ ] Complete Provenance
- [ ] Stable Structuring


Best Practices

### Continuous Integration / Delivery

System integration during development and automated delivery to production are complex topics
with many requirements and existing tools.

Current approaches introduce much unnecessary latency with significant affect on the 
ability for teams to deliver. This latency is the root cause for an unimaginable
amount of wasted effort and stress for individuals.

The workspace addresses the problem of latency in the systems development process
by providing many rapid parallel paths to running code without the need for complete builds.

Changed code is built and tested in a distributed mesh and delivered to a runtime
by configuration change. The concept of CI / CD vanishes as users build against an always
running system able to provide instant feedback.


### Build Process

Building or bundling code in some form is an inevitable necessity and there are an
infinate number of different approaches and implementations in every possible
realm of software development.

Building code is a slow process and when it is tied to timelines and cycles it represents
a major constricting force to the ability for teams to deliver.

The workspace addresses this constriction in the development process by
promoting the building and deployment of runtime containers able to load lighweight
business logic components on demand. Any part of the codebase that receives any
significant amount of regular changes should have an optimized realtime deployment approach
setup.

Components are well defined units of functionality able to build rapidly and
able to run in pre-configured runtime containers. This architecture not only
allows for rapid deployment of changes but more fundamentally allows for the
introduction of capability-based computing where code executes in restricted
sandboxes only able to leverage capabilities specifically given.
